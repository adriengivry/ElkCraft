# What is ElkCraft ?
Here is ElkCraft, a Minecraft clone made with C++/OpenGL during 5 weeks in a group of 4 programmers.
The actual version allows you to play in an infinite world, generated at runtime, where you can build, destroy and mining or crafting things.
We implemented a health and a hunger system. There is also a day and night cycle.
Monsters aren't implemented.
